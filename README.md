# PyBer_Analysis
Create a more affordable "Car Driving Service" using PyBer and other tools
#**Overview of the Analysis**
In this analysis we used Python, Pandas, and and Matplotlib to create visualizations on our ride share data. The components of this info were rural, urban, and suburban areas. The data that we used was the ride data and city: 
1. In the ride data we used the city, date, fare, and, ride IDs. This data helped us understand the total what would be the fares in different cities with our clients/riders
2. In the city data we used the city, driver count, and type of city (rural, urban, suburban) to understand better understand the traffic quantity of per our drivers in the region.

#**Results:**
We gathered info!

This chart shows the number of average, fare, rides and drivers in different cities.

#**Summary:**
We can conclude that Urban cities have the highest rides, fares, and drivers per city. There were 125 rides in rural, 625 rides in suburban, and 1,625 rides in urban cities and a total 2,450 drivers through the months January 2019 and May 2019.
* Total profit for:
- Rural Areas had a total profit of $4327.93
- Suburban Areas has a total of $19356.33 
- Urband Areas $39854.38
* The average fare drive per ride was:
- Rural $34.62 
- Suburban $30.97
-  Urban $24.53 
* The average fare for drivers was: 
- Rural $55.49
- Suburban $39.50
- Urban $16.57 
To conclude: We can increase profits by lowering costs in Rural areas and slightly increase in Urban areas. This so could motivate rural areas by the lower prices and since Urban areas has a more rides we can stretch this elastic demand but to the point of stay competitive.
